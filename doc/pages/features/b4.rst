B4 model
========

Theory
------

The present model is based on the B4 model proposed by Bazant et al. (2015) generalized to 3D.
The constitutive law is given in total form as

.. math::

   \sig = \Cel : \epsE  = \Cel : \left( \eps - \epsVE - \epsF - \epsDC -\epsSHR \right)

relating the nominal stress tensor :math:`\sig`
to the elastic strain tensor :math:`\epsE`
in terms of the fourth order stiffness tensor :math:`\Cel`.
